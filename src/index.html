            <p class="text">A graphic designer works on a variety of products and activities, such as websites, advertising, books, magazines, posters, computer games, product packaging, exhibitions and displays, corporate communications and corporate identity, i.e. giving organisations a visual brand.
              Graphic designers create visual concepts, by hand or using computer software, to communicate ideas that inspire, inform, or captivate consumers. They develop the overall layout and production design for advertisements, brochures, magazines, and corporate reports.
              You'll work to a brief agreed with the client, creative director or account manager, and will develop appropriate creative ideas and concepts for the <em>client's objectives</em>.
              The work demands creative flair, up-to-date knowledge of industry software and a professional approach to time, costs and deadlines. *</p>
